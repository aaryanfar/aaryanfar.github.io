== Brief Bio 
I am a Scientific Researcher at [http://www.caltech.edu California Institute of Technology] as well as Assistant Professor at [https://bau.edu.tr/ Bahçeşehir University]. My research mainly is on developing devices and multiphysics methods for energy related applications, including designing state-of-the-art high energy, safe and self-sustaining rechargeable batteries and predicting the corrosion/fracture of materials in extreme states. Here is more on my [http://aaryanfar.github.io/Background.html Background], [http://aaryanfar.github.io/Research.html Research], [http://aaryanfar.github.io/Publications.html Publications] and [http://aaryanfar.github.io/Teaching.html Teaching] experiences as well as my [http://aaryanfar.github.io/Resume_AsgharAryanfar_14Aug19.pdf Resume\/CV].
